# Spring Boot API Starter

## Getting Started

### DB SETUP
`application.properties` will need to be updated with your username, and or db name.
Check out the database.sql for getting books to work. Books are just an example!

### GRADLE WRAPPER
To start your server, type `./gradlew bootrun` 

To stop, `control + c` (same as node)
